# Study scientific computing

**Dates: November 2021**

**Location: NCAS HQ, University of Leeds**

## Intro section...

The Introduction to Scientific Computing course covers the skills needed for 
effective data management and analysis using Linux and Python.

The aim of the course is to equip students with fundamental knowledge and 
skills to allow them to start using computers for cutting-edge environmental 
science research. We will also provide you with the necessary experience needed 
to attend our [Data Analysis Tools](https://www.ncas.ac.uk/study-with-us/data-analysis-tools/) course.

## HOW TO APPLY

Registration for 2021/22 courses will open by the end of September 2021

Introduction to Scientific Computing is designed for PhD students and early 
career researchers in atmospheric and environmental science.

Itâ€™s suitable for those with no previous experience in either Linux or Python, 
as well as those who have used them a little and wish to improve their skills.
