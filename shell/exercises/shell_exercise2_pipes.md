<h1>>Exercise 2: Pipes and filters</h1>
<h2>Aim</h2>
Construct a command using pipes and filters to print just the name of the longest file.
<h2>Issues Covered</h2>
Commands: cat, wc, head, tail, cut, sort, uniq, |, *, ?
Using shell command completion and history.
Instructions
1. In the directory "acsoe/eae-97/macehead" construct a pipe and filter command to print the file with the most lines. (Hint: use head, tail, wc, sort and cut
2. Use the up arrow to edit the last command. Change the command to look for the longest file in characters.  
3. Use "*" to look for the longest file in all the subdirectories of "acsoe/eae-97".
4. Have a play with the arrow keys and the tab key - what do they do? Try the history command. 

 

Solution 2: Pipes and filters


1.
wc -l eae-97/macehead/* | sort -n | tail -n 2 | head -n 1 | cut -c 10-

As an alternative to the last command in the above pipeline, cut -f 2 -d ' '
will extract the second field, using space as delimiter between fields – more robust if the character width can vary.

2.
wc -m eae-97/macehead/* | sort -n | tail -n 2 | head -n 1 | cut -c 10-

3.
wc -m eae-97/*/* | sort -n | tail -n 2 | head -n 1 | cut -c 10-

4. 
Up and down arrows scroll through the command history of the shell (very useful for repeating the same commands). The tab key makes suggestions for completing what you are typing. Often tab completion writes the rest of the filename after typing in the start of it. Tab key twice lists all possible completion alternatives. The history command lists the command history; use !33 to run the 33rd entry in the history list.
