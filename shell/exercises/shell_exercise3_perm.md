To get comfortable with Unix permission system.

## Issues covered
Commands: `chmod`, `ls -l`, `more`, `less`, `chgrp`

## Instructions
1.  Explain permissions to other people.
    1. Change directory to `acsoe/freetex-98/Jungfrau`. 
    2. Use `ls –l` to look at the files.
    3. Run the script `./set_chmod.sh`.  This script will change the permissions on some of the files in this directory.

        $ ./set_chmod.sh

    4. Use `ls –l` again to look at the file permissions.
    5. Pair up and describe to your partner what the permission mean.
    6. Use the `more` (or `less`) command to see if you can access the files. Try to run the files.

2. Which do you think are most sensible set of permissions.
    1. Change the files to have sensible permissions.
    2. Make a new directory
    3. Experiment with the permissions on the directory.
